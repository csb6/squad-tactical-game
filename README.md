Project 1 (A working title)

	This is a prototype for a game made using Ruby and the Tk GUI Toolkit. The game is a turn-based management/strategy game; the player controls a Pacific island with a military base on it. Includes the following features:
	-Hierarchy/responsibilities:
		Who gets which jobs, which jobs have which responsibilities
		Ex: Appoint Timmy Two-Shoes to position of Chief Birdwatcher, give him responsibility of securing hangars
	
	-Relations with the mother country:
		Players can send/receive messages from the department of defense; this affects budget, resources given
		Ex: Telling SoD to "cuss off you sodden oaf" will most likely result in less frequent fuel shipments
		
	-Battle strategies
		Invaders will lurk around your island, hoping to invade. Meet them on the sea and in the air, using two different interfaces
		
	-Commander's Log
		Write personal notes and plans in this handy built-in text editor, saved until next session
		
	-Multiplayer?
